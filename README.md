# Open Duck Playground

# Installation 

Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

# Training

If you want to use the [imitation reward](https://la.disneyresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/BD_X_paper.pdf), you can generate reference motion with [this repo](https://github.com/apirrone/Open_Duck_reference_motion_generator)

Then copy `polynomial_coefficients.pkl` in `playground/<robot>/data/`

You'll also have to set `USE_IMITATION_REWARD=True` in it's `joystick.py` file

Run: 

```bash
uv run playground/<robot>/runner.py 
```

## Tensorboard

```bash
uv run tensorboard --logdir=<yourlogdir>
```

# Inference 

Infer mujoco

(for now this is specific to open_duck_mini_v2)

```bash
uv run playground/open_duck_mini_v2/mujoco_infer.py -o <path_to_.onnx> (-k)
```
